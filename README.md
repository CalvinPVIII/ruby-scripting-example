# ruby-scripting-example

This is a brief example of the basics of Ruby scripting and how everything works together. Also included is an example in Javascript that shows how the same tasks is accomplished in a different language.

The "lib" folder will contain all of your classes and other business logic, and your "spec" folder will contain your tests for everything in you lib folder.

The "script.rb" file is your user interface, and will be how you can get input for your user and then decided what to do with that input.

Your script file will be responsible for creating the instance of your class, and will act similarly to a document.ready function.
